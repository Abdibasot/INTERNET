    <h1><b>Internet Protocols and IP Address</b></h1>

    <p>
        <b>Internet Protocols (IP)</b> are a set of rules that govern how data is sent and received over the internet. 
        Their <b>function</b> is to ensure reliable communication between devices on a network. 
        Common examples of protocols include <b>HTTP</b>, <b>HTTPS</b>, <b>FTP</b>, <b>TCP/IP</b>, and <b>SMTP</b>.
    </p>

    <h2><b>Types and Versions of IP Addresses</b></h2>

    <p>
        <b>IP addresses</b> are unique identifiers assigned to each device on a network to enable communication. 
        There are two main versions of IP addresses: <b>IPv4</b> and <b>IPv6</b>. 
        <b>IPv4</b> uses a 32-bit address format, while <b>IPv6</b> uses a 128-bit format to accommodate more devices.
        The <b>differences</b> between these versions impact how devices are connected and managed on the internet. 
        IP addresses are crucial in real-world applications such as website hosting, email delivery, and online communication.
